Time coding: 1h

THIS IS THE README FILE THAT WILL KEEP THE DESCRIPTION AND THE PATCH UPDATES THAT ILL BE MAKING IN THE PROJECT

IMPORTANT NOTE: - The web is made in Spanish but I have intention to translate it to English and Korean, I decided
to start it in my native language becouse it will be easier for me to learn html and css if I dont need to focus
on what im thyping. The side notes, path updates and descriptions will all be in English becouse I want to upload 
this web to github just as a project that anyone can watch. - END OF IMPORTANT NOTE

IMPORTANT NOTE: - The versions will be divided by beta (pre-released and almost finished version), alpha (not polished 
early state of a version, ready to test but not to release) and pre-alpha (barely started version of the web)
- END OF IMPORTANT NOTE

DESCRIPTION: This is my first ever real project and is made for fun and learning so at first it will be very scuffed.
            Anyways it will be a webpage that will include a lot of features, at first it will be like a demo version
            and if I see good welcoming Ill keep working on it to make it full of functionality and content so it becomes
            a great tool for league players in general, to not only know what champions do but to master the game in the
            best way possible.
